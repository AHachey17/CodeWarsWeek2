# CodeWarsWeek2
## Every week I will be posting a weekly Repo that I update daily with complete CodeWar Katas
### Week2
Day 6: 8KYU, HELLO WORLD - simply created function that returns string 'Hello World'
```
function greet() {
   return"hello world!"
 } 
```
Day 7: 8KYU, SQUARING ARGUMENT - created a function that takes the a number as a parameter and returns the number squared
```
function square(num){
 return num ** 2
}
```
Day 8: 8KYU, INCORRECT DIVISION(Debugging) - The issue with this code was that they had 2 division operators instead of one like below.
```
const solve = (x, y) => x / y}
```
Day 9: 8KYU, OPPOSITES ATTRACT - Given a function with 2 numbers as parameters, I created a expresson that will take the value of each number and return true if one is even and one is odd, and false if they are both even or if they are both odd.
```
function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  return (flower1 + flower2) % 2 !== 0
 
}
```
Day10: 8KYU, CAT & DOG YEARS - Need to work on this codewar, struggled with creating functions that have rounds of different instructions.
